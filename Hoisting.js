What is Hoisting?

Hoisting means JavaScript moves declarations to the top of their scope (before the code executes) — so you can use functions or variables before you actually declare them in your code.

In short:

        “Declarations are hoisted, not initializations.”


console.log(a); // Output: undefined
var a = 5;
console.log(a); // Output: 5


//Hoisting 
var a;
console.log(a); // undefined (a is declared but not assigned yet)
a = 5;
console.log(a); // 5



Example 2: let and const are also hoisted — but differently!
console.log(x); // ❌ ReferenceError
let x = 10;


🧠 Why error?
Because let and const are hoisted but kept in a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ) until the line where they are declared.
You can’t access them before that point.

So:

var → hoisted and initialized as undefined

let and const → hoisted but not initialized (accessing before declaration gives an error)


Function Hoisting:
Example 3: Function Declaration
sayHello(); // ✅ Works fine

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}


✅ Works! Because function declarations are completely hoisted — the entire function definition moves to the top.

Example 4: Function Expression
sayHi(); // ❌ TypeError

var sayHi = function() {
  console.log("Hi!");
};


🧠 Why?
Because only the variable sayHi is hoisted (as undefined), not the function itself.
So when you call it, it’s like doing:

var sayHi;
sayHi(); // sayHi is undefined ⇒ TypeError

🪄 Summary Table
Type	Hoisted?	Initialized?	Can be used before declaration?
var	✅ Yes	✅ As undefined	⚠️ Yes, but gives undefined
let	✅ Yes	❌ No	❌ ReferenceError
const	✅ Yes	❌ No	❌ ReferenceError
Function Declaration	✅ Yes	✅ Full definition	✅ Yes
Function Expression	✅ Yes (variable only)	✅ As undefined	❌ TypeError
🧩 Visual Analogy

Imagine JavaScript scans your code twice:

First pass (Memory creation): It finds all declarations (var, let, const, function) and sets them up.

Second pass (Execution): It runs the code line by line.

So hoisting happens in the first pass.

🏁 In Simple Words

    Hoisting means JavaScript “lifts up” all declarations (but not assignments) to the top of the scope, so you can technically use them before they appear in your code — but only safely for function declarations and var.
